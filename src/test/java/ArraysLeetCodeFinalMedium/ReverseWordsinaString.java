Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words.
The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

Output: "blue is sky the"
