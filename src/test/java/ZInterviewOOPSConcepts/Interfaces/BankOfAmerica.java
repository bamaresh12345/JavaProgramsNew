 An interface in Java is a blueprint of a behaviour. A Java interface contains static constants and abstract methods.

The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
By default, variables in an interface are public, static, and final.
It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritances in Java.
It is also used to achieve loose coupling.
In other words, interfaces primarily define methods that other classes must implement.
An interface in Java defines a set of behaviours that a class can implement, usually representing an IS-A relationship,
 but not always in every scenario.
